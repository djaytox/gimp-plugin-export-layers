Requirements
------------

* GIMP 2.8 or later
* Python 2.7 or later from the 2.7.x series


Windows
-------

### Installer

Simply run the Windows installer and customize plug-in installation path as needed.
If you have a portable GIMP installation, you will be prompted to specify the path to GIMP and GIMP plug-ins manually.


### Manual installation (ZIP package)

Make sure you have GIMP installed with support for Python scripting.

Copy the following files and folders:

    export_layers.py
    export_layers

to the folder containing plug-ins depending on your version of GIMP, usually one of the following:

* GIMP 2.8: `C:\Users\[your username]\.gimp-2.8\plug-ins`
* GIMP 2.10: `C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plug-ins`

If you can't locate the folder, open GIMP, go to "Edit → Preferences → Folders → Plug-Ins" and use one of the listed folders.


Linux
-----

Copy the following files and folders:

    export_layers.py
    export_layers

to the folder containing plug-ins depending on your version of GIMP, usually one of the following:

* GIMP 2.8: `/home/[your username]/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins`
* GIMP 2.10: `/home/[your username]/.config/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins`

If you can't locate the folder, open GIMP, go to "Edit → Preferences → Folders → Plug-Ins" and use one of the listed folders.

To check if the correct version of Python is installed, start GIMP and go to "Filters → Python-Fu → Console".
The console must display "Python 2.7" or later from the 2.7.x series.
If not, install Python 2.7, open `/usr/lib/gimp/2.0/interpreters/pygimp.interp` and change its contents to the following:

    python=[path to Python 2.7 executable]
    /usr/bin/python=[path to Python 2.7 executable]
    :Python:E::py::python:

`[path to Python 2.7 executable]` is usually `/usr/bin/python` or `/usr/bin/python2.7`.


macOS
-----

Copy the following files and folders:

    export_layers.py
    export_layers

to the folder containing plug-ins depending on your version of GIMP, usually one of the following:

* GIMP 2.8: `/Users/[your username]/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.8/plug-ins`
* GIMP 2.10: `/Users/[your username]/Library/Application Support/GIMP/2.10/plug-ins`

If you can't locate the folder, open GIMP, go to "Edit → Preferences → Folders → Plug-Ins" and use one of the listed folders.


Upgrading to 3.3 <a name="Upgrading-from-Earlier-Versions"></a>
----------------

Due to significant changes in version 3.3, make sure you first perform complete reinstall when upgrading from an earlier version:

1. Still using the old version, run Export Layers, select "Settings → Show More Settings", check "Remove procedures and constraints" and reset settings by pressing the "Reset Settings" button.
2. Close Export Layers.
3. Close GIMP.
4. Remove the `export_layers.py` file and the `export_layers` folder from the installation folder.
   If you used 3.0-RC1, remove the `pygimplib` folder as well.
5. In the folder above `plug-ins`, open `parasiterc` in a text editor and remove the entire line beginning with `(parasite "plug_in_export_layers"`.
6. Run GIMP without Export Layers installed (so that GIMP "forgets" about the plug-in).
7. Install the new version.

You can still upgrade to the newest version if you did not perform steps 5 and 6.
A warning dialog will ask you to reset the settings.
However, calling `pdb.plug_in_export_layers` from the command line will probably result in an execution error due to the mismatch of arguments.
